## Description

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. This implementation of the Hangman game features the computer selecting a word, and the user attempting to guess it.

The aim of this project is to provide an entertaining game experience for users. During the development process, I gained insights into user interaction, random word selection, and game flow control.

## Installation

To run the Hangman game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-game.git
